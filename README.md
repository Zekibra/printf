# printf
A simple printf function built by Abdurehman Hassen and arit Etienam

#WELCOME
A rebuild of the standard printf function in C. Our project required a function capable of printing with the %d, %c, %s, and %% specifiers to standard output. printf returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte at the end of strings).

# Format Specifiers
Our team chose to add %x ,%X, %b, %o, %u, %r, %R, and %p formatting. We relied on the library we have been building at Alx as well as new concepts gathered during this project.

# Supported Format Types

c - Single character

s - String

r - String in reverse

R - String in rot13

d - Integer in decimal

i - integer

o - octal

u - unsigned

p - pointer
